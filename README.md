Project Name: Linear Regression using Gradient Descent for combined cycle power planet
Project Description: 
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power    Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP).
